## Bonus (Optional Section)

### Much bonus goes to anyone who implements AWS hosting for images on posts
**This API has an endpoint for an amazon signkey that you can use to post files/images/data to an S3 bucket. No gems, no paperclip!!**
Posts have images, one featured image, and one thumbnail image. Make this functionaility in the front end. You will need to setup your AWS account, apply for S3 service, configure your S3 service, and create an IAM account with the appropriate credentials.

Some resources for this:

- [AWS S3 Getting Started](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)
- [Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms](https://aws.amazon.com/articles/Amazon-S3/1434)

### Much more bonus goes to anyone who builds an image gallery for each post view.
### Much bonus goes to anyone who builds individual views for each post
### Show the categories for each post
### Much more bonus goes to anyone who implements a front-end templating library like [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) or [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
